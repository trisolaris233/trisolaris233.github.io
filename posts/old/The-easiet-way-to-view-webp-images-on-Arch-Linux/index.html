  <h1>The easiet way to view webp images on Arch Linux</h1>
  <p>Yesterday&hellip; Or just early today, I was just looking for some pictures about Misaki Mei, Ano kawaii girl that I came up with at a moment, she was from an anime which cames from a light novel together with a manga. It&rsquo;s funny that the three edition has quite a different stories. I had only watched the anime during last summer, the picnic anime faded with so cute a girl involved. Who TM would be scared?</p>
<p>{% asset_img misaki_mei.jpg %}</p>
<p>That was the case I found some .webp images.</p>
<p>And I found the <code>Gwenview</code>, my KDE Plasma default image viewer, I love it pretty much, but it did not support to view webp image files.</p>
<p>Then I go to google for help, and I ended up finding a pile of like Top n Best Programs to view webp files on Linux, at this time, the google was not better than Baidu as before it used to. Then I used the gThumb.</p>
<p>But gThumb was a mother-fucker program, I did not like it. For I am convinced that <code>GwenView NB</code>.So I was eager to find alternative way to solve the simple requirement of viewing webp images.</p>
<p>Luckily, I fond <code>vwebp</code>, I loved this name because <code>IT IS CLEAR</code>. You can easily download vwebp from <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download">google&rsquo;s website</a>(ps: You should search with keyword webp rather than vwebp, which would only give you shit)</p>
<p>You just simply downloaded it and extracted it. the directory will look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">zytc@etc:Downloads/libwebp-1.0.3-linux-x86-64 $ ll

</code></pre></div><p>and the executable binary is in the directory <code>bin</code>, what you need to do is simply create a symbolic link to the <code>vwebp</code> binary to one of your <code>$PATH </code>directory, generally <code>/usr/bin</code>, as below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">zytc@etc:~$ ln -s bin/vwebp /usr/bin/webp
</code></pre></div><p>and it would do what you want. However, I created and try to run the command it crashed with an error.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">zytc@etc:Downloads/libwebp-1.0.3-linux-x86-64 $ vwebp --version
vwebp: error <span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> loading shared libraries: libglut.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</code></pre></div><p>it seemed a f**king library is needed for vwebp to run properly. In fact, our system lacked of <code>glut</code>, which provides several openGL operations, you can install with <code>yay -S glut</code> and select the <code>freeglut</code> to install it. After all the stuff get over, it just got its way. then input</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">zytc@etc:~$ vwebp ~/gallery/Misaki_mei/ &amp;
zytc@etc:~$ sudo pacman -Rs gthumb-lite
</code></pre></div><p>{% asset_img screenshot.png %}</p>
<p><strong>Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</strong>, F**k, kanojo wa so cute!!!!!(●´∀`●)</p>
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h2>
<p>so the easies way to view webp images on arch linux is</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the webp tools from google, as above</li>
<li>Install glut</li>
<li>Create symbolic links or other ways you can get <code>vwebp</code> work.</li>
<li><del>UNINSTALL GTHUMB</del></li>
</ul>
